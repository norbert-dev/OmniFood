# OmniFood
OmniFood Training Project by Jonas Schmedtmann

This project was followed thru on StackSkills website. The project is basicaly about a healthy food vendor providing omnifood in 4 cities.

The project mainly focuses on HTML5 coding as well as Brackets IDE also worth to mention that I personaly used VSC within the project.
Within the HTML codes it is using almost all possible HTML tags which is handy.
Also focuses on CSS3, minimal JavaScripting and even less <?php>.

PHP is only used as showcase for the mailing app.

The source code has been sectioned by HTML comments by me. This is not part of the original code. Also the ion-icons are modified since the once used in the tutorial training are not valid once. At least not anymore.

Hope you like the content and fell free to use the code if you like it.
